Software systems need regular maintenance and enhancement and this upkeep is greatly facilitated if the implicit architecture is known. In order to understand the architecture, a tool is needed to make sense of the mass of data that can be extracted and to this end a navigable chord diagram was   developed to present a scalable visualisation of a Java systems architecture. Using Massey Architecture Explorer (MAE) as a foundation, the work of Holten (2006) was applied to ultimately develop a tool that enables the user to navigate compound graphs to see both high level patterns and low level detail. The project is analogous to the way Google Earth allows a user to meaningfully navigate their way through the mass of data presented in a world map.
The visualisation tool’s strength lies in its ability to enable a user to pilot both vertically through layers of abstraction and horizontally to comprehend the relationships between nodes. This ability is mitigated by the fact that only limited refinement has been possible at this point. The project has however clearly demonstrated the future viability of navigable chord diagrams to make sense of systems architecture and more generally its use in understanding compound graphs.
